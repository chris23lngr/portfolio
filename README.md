# Personal portfolio
This project is my personal portfolio. The website can be found at christoph-langer.de. 
The designs and the development of the website were done by me. 

## Story
I have always had new designs and ideas for a personal portfolio, but have never actually implemented them. Often it simply failed because I had no interest or no time at the end.

This time, however, I really finished my project and published it.
